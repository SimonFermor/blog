## Steps

As an Administrator, launch the command prompt.

Navigate to the ColdFusion installation bin folder.

A typical folder location: C:\>ColdFusion2025\cfusion\bin

Run the batch file passwordreset.bat.  There will then be prompts to change the Admin password.

After resetting the password, the ColdFusion service will need to be restated.
